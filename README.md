## Requiremments
- CARLsim6: https://github.com/UCI-CARL/CARLsim5
- ECJ: https://github.com/GMUEClab/ecj
- MATLAB 2017a

## Generate input stimuli
Stimuli in the training, validation, and test datasets can be generated with the MATLAB script `matlab_analysis_scripts/GenerateInputStim/generateInputStim.m`.

## Network Simulation
### evolve_MST_SNN_model_CARLsim
- Project code to evolve network parameters.
- Compile with `make`, and use `./launchCARLsimECJ.sh` to launch evolutionary runs. Network fitness values and evolved hyper-parameters are saved to out.stat.

### test_MST_SNN_model_CARLsim
- Project code that includes additional test trials.
- Pass in evolved parameters to simulate individual networks. Network activity and trial indices are saved in the `results` folder.

## Analysis scripts
Folder `matlab_analysis_scripts` contains MATLAB scripts for data analysis and visualization. These scripts were partially based on code developed for Beyeler et al. (2016).
